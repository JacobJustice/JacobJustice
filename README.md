### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior at Appalachian State University, looking to go to graduate school.

Recently, I've been learning game development but my long-time interests have been with Data Science and Computer Graphics.

Here you can find tools I've made for web scraping or processing data, my larger projects such as an API for making paintings and drawings with a uArm Swift Pro, or hackathon projects that I've been a part of.

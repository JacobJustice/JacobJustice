### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

On my GitHub you can find tools I've made for web scraping or processing data, my larger projects such as an API for making paintings and drawings with a uArm Swift Pro, or hackathon projects that I've been a part of.

I also have an itch.io with a variety of my game jam submissions! https://jacobjustice.itch.io/

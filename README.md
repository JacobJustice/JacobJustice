### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Bamberg in Germany.

My research is in Computer Graphics and Animation.

On my GitHub you can find tools I've made for web scraping or processing data, my larger projects such as an API for making paintings and drawings with a uArm Swift Pro, or hackathon projects that I've been a part of.

I also have an itch.io with my two top-rated game jam submissions FEED and Magnet Panic! https://jacobjustice.itch.io/
